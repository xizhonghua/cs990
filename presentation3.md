## Finial Presentation
This is the script for the final presentation

Instructions by Dr. Stephen G. Nash:

*'As guidance, I would like you to make an overall presentation based on your dissertation proposal that includes:
An overview of the research area
A discussion of related research
A description of one/some of your research questions/hypotheses
A plan for how you might conduct the research'*

*'In preparing your final presentation, think about the overall story that you are telling.  You are trying to persuade the audience that you are working in an important area, that you are familiar with what others have already accomplished, that there are unanswered research questions, that you have clear an specific goals, and that you have ideas for how to accomplish those goals.'*

*'It is unwise to try to cram too many ideas into a short talk.  It is better to focus on a subset of the problem.  And it isn't necessary to explain all the details.  If you have managed to generate interest among members of the audience, they can talk to you afterwards.'*

### Introdution

### Research Area
My research mainly focus on the following tree areas: 

First as you may know, is rigid origami. 
I am mainly focus on problem of modeling the origami that is how to repsent the origami, what's the state space and kinematics of the origami etc.

Secoind is the sampling-based motion planning which is used to find the foldable and collision free path for rigid origami from a flat of sheet to its target shape.
